# This post is to show what various elements look like

# This is H1

## This is H2, just under H1

### This is H3

#### This is H4

##### This is H5

###### This is H6

This is just (paragraph) text, under all of the headings. The content width is limited, using the default set by `@tailwindcss/typography` and `prose`. \<- **This** was an example of inline code. It's generally useful for short code snippets, and are enclosed in single ` (backticks). For longer code blocks, use triple backticks a line above/below the block. Add things like language to enable code highlighting.

```css
body {
  background-color: blue;
}
.yourclass {
  margin: 2px;
}
```

The above is achieved with:

````markdown
```css
body {
  background-color: blue;
}
.yourclass {
  margin: 2px;
}
```
````

| Col1              | Col2                 | Col3         | Col4        |

| This              | is what a            | table        | looks like  |
| Markdown _tables_ | are **quite** simple | to           | generate    |
| and Prose         | handles              | all **_of_** | the styling |

1. This is an ordered list
1. It doesn't actually matter what number you prefix each item with
1. Markdown renderers account for this
1. Even if you do something odd.

- In contrast, this is an unordered list.
- Each item is prefixed with a hypen and space (`- `)
- Unordered lists are probably more common than ordered lists.
