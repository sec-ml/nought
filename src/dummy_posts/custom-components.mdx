## Callouts

These callouts are fairly stock from [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/components/alert/), and use the standard theme warning, success, error, info colours:

<Info>Here's a bit of info for you!</Info>
<Warning>But be careful how you use it...</Warning>
<Error>This is what it'll look like when it goes wrong.</Error>
<Success>But the chance of success is often worth the risk!</Success>
<Alert>You just have to make sure you're always alert to the possibility.</Alert>

#### Usage:

```mdx
<Info>Here's a bit of info for you!</Info>
<Warning>But be careful how you use it...</Warning>
<Error>This is what it'll look like when it goes wrong.</Error>
<Success>But the chance of success is often worth the risk!</Success>
<Alert>You just have to make sure you're always alert to the possibility.</Alert>
```

## Blockquote with citation

A wrapper for markdown blockquotes, which allows you to set a citation (label and URL). For reference, this is a normal markdown blockquote:

> This is a normal markdown blockquote.
```markdown
> This is a normal markdown blockquote.
```
... and this is the `<Cite>` component:

<Cite>Cite component with no label or url set</Cite>
<Cite label="nought.">Cite component with only label set</Cite>
<Cite url="https://nought.vercel.app/custom-components">Cite component with only URL set (the cite attribute is set in HTML... you won't actually see it here).</Cite>
<Cite label="nought." url="https://nought.vercel.app/custom-components">Cite component with label and url set.</Cite>
<Cite label="nought." url="https://nought.vercel.app/custom-components" big>How about a more prominent quote?</Cite>

#### Usage:

```mdx showLineNumbers
<Cite>Cite component with no label or url set</Cite>
<Cite label="nought.">Cite component with only label set</Cite>
<Cite url="https://nought.vercel.app/custom-components">Cite component with only URL set (the cite attribute is set in HTML... you won't actually see it here).</Cite>
<Cite label="nought." url="https://nought.vercel.app/custom-components">Cite component with label and url set.</Cite>
```

## Diagrams

Custom component for displaying diagrams (or drawings, sketches, images). 
<Diag light='true'>![example excalidraw diagram](images/example.excalidraw.png)</Diag>

`light='true'` sets the diagram's lightness/darkness:

```mdx
<Diag light='true'>![example excalidraw diagram](images/example.excalidraw.png)</Diag>
```
This is how it is displayed on a dark theme:
![example diagram on dark theme](images/diag-dark_display.png)
And this is how it is displayed on a light theme:
![example diagram on light theme](images/diag-light_display.png)

With `bg='no'`:
```mdx
<Diag light='true' bg='no'>![example excalidraw diagram](images/example.excalidraw.png)</Diag>
```
<Diag light='true' bg='no'>![example excalidraw diagram](images/example.excalidraw.png)</Diag>

Or override background colour:
```mdx
<Diag light='true' bg='#e9ef33'>![example excalidraw diagram](images/example.excalidraw.png)</Diag>
<Diag light='true' bg='bg-secondary'>![example excalidraw diagram](images/example.excalidraw.png)</Diag>
```
<Diag light='true' bg='#e9ef33'>![example excalidraw diagram](images/example.excalidraw.png)</Diag>
<Diag light='true' bg='bg-secondary'>![example excalidraw diagram](images/example.excalidraw.png)</Diag>
