## Callouts

These callouts are fairly stock from [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/components/alert/), and use the standard theme warning, success, error, info colours:

<Info>Here's a bit of info for you!</Info>
<Warning>But be careful how you use it...</Warning>
<Error>This is what it'll look like when it goes wrong.</Error>
<Success>But the chance of success is often worth the risk!</Success>
<Alert>You just have to make sure you're always alert to the possibility.</Alert>

#### Usage:

```mdx
<Info>Here's a bit of info for you!</Info>
<Warning>But be careful how you use it...</Warning>
<Error>This is what it'll look like when it goes wrong.</Error>
<Success>But the chance of success is often worth the risk!</Success>
<Alert>You just have to make sure you're always alert to the possibility.</Alert>
```

## Blockquote with citation

A wrapper for markdown blockquotes, which allows you to set a citation (label and URL). For reference, this is a normal markdown blockquote:

> This is a normal markdown blockquote.
```markdown
> This is a normal markdown blockquote.
```
... and this is the `<Cite>` component:

<Cite>Cite component with no label or url set</Cite>
<Cite label="nought.">Cite component with only label set</Cite>
<Cite url="https://nought.vercel.app/custom-components">Cite component with only URL set (the cite attribute is set in HTML... you won't actually see it here).</Cite>
<Cite label="nought." url="https://nought.vercel.app/custom-components">Cite component with label and url set.</Cite>

#### Usage:

```mdx

```markdown
<Cite>Cite component with no label or url set</Cite>
<Cite label="nought.">Cite component with only label set</Cite>
<Cite url="https://nought.vercel.app/custom-components">Cite component with only URL set (the cite attribute is set in HTML... you won't actually see it here).</Cite>
<Cite label="nought." url="https://nought.vercel.app/custom-components">Cite component with label and url set.</Cite>
```
